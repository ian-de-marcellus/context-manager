/**
 * KV-stable context controller — the rev 5.0 single-path solve
 * (see `docs/adaptive-resolution-design.md` §13; supersedes the two-path
 * fold-within-reach + emergency design of §12, and the older prose in
 * `docs/kv-stable-context-control.md` where they conflict).
 *
 * One algorithm per turn, one hard constraint:
 *
 *   minimize    relevance_loss(F) + perturbation(F, F_prev)   [lexicographic]
 *   subject to  render(F) ≤ W            — the only physics
 *               perturbation(F, F_prev) ≤ P   — trust region; overridable
 *
 * - The IDEAL CUT is built from scratch each turn by pure relevance: fold in
 *   salience-then-age priority order, level by level, under the soft shape
 *   prior (`foldDepthCap`), past it if W demands, never past the hard
 *   protections (flat zone / pins / locked); then pack youngest-first back
 *   toward the target. Age/salience-monotone by construction.
 * - PERTURBATION is exact, not modeled: `kvCost` — the tokens the provider
 *   will re-read from the earliest layout divergence to the end.
 * - P (`reachTokens`, re-priced) is a TRUST REGION on per-turn divergence,
 *   not a spatial eligibility gate. Within it the solver adopts the ideal;
 *   beyond it it adopts the ideal's newest changes only (suffix adoption —
 *   perturbation is prefix-based, so partial adoption is exactly a suffix
 *   cut) and converges over turns, receding-horizon style.
 * - OVERRIDES (same code path, recorded on the plan, logged by the caller):
 *   'bootstrap' (no carried frontier — nothing to preserve), 'infeasible'
 *   (nothing within P fits under W), 'quality-gap' (the best plan within P
 *   is certifiably bad vs the ideal). There is no emergency path.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic.

 * A leaf folded to level k renders as part of its L_k ancestor node, and that
 * node is atomic over its whole covered range — so EVERY leaf under it must share
 * level k, or the node is unrenderable. The picker walks group-atomic raise/lower
 * ops, so a frontier that folds only SOME leaves under a node is an unreachable
 * target: it raises the group (over-folding a sibling), lowers it (under-folding
 * another), forever — non-convergence (the wedge this fixes).
 *
 * Frontiers seeded per-chunk from the carried `previous` frontier can violate
 * this: as a summary group accretes new raw leaves over turns while older leaves
 * stay folded, its leaves end up at mixed levels. shed/expand only re-consolidate
 * groups they actively move; a mixed group sitting in the budget dead-band passes
 * through untouched. This pass repairs it.
 *
 * Shallowest-first: where a group disagrees, UN-fold the folded leaves one level
 * toward raw (preserving continuity), cascading until every folded leaf's group
 * is unanimous. Monotone (only lowers) → terminates. Any budget breach from the
 * extra raw is re-folded whole-group by the shed pass that runs afterward.
