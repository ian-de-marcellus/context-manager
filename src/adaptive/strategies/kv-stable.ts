/**
 * KvStableStrategy — the KV-stable context controller as a folding SOLVER
 * (the rev 5.0 single-path solve; see `docs/adaptive-resolution-design.md`
 * §13. `docs/kv-stable-context-control.md` is the historical "why" and the
 * measurement harness).
 *
 * One `solve` call computes the complete target frontier with
 * `planControlledFrontier` (the *same* policy the replay harness measures)
 * and returns it for the picker to apply directly.
 *
 * It minimizes real prefix churn: it holds the flat zone (head/tail/pinned)
 * raw, never folds locked chunks, honors V2 leveled pins (`pinLevel` /
 * `pinMaxLevel`) as fixed levels / hard fold-depth caps, and reconciles a
 * from-scratch relevance-ideal cut against the carried frontier under a
 * perturbation TRUST REGION P (exact kvCost, not a spatial gate) — adopting
 * the ideal within P, amortizing bigger repairs via suffix adoption, and
 * exceeding P only with a recorded override. There is no emergency path.
 *
 * It does not SPECULATIVELY emit produce requests — deeper folding than has
 * been produced is the speculative pre-producer's job; the controller only
 * targets levels whose summaries already exist. The one exception is DEMAND
 * under escalation (issue #56): when even full folding exceeds the hard wall
 * W while foldable chunks have no L1 coverage at all, production is the only
 * remaining lever, and the caller's demand path (`handleProducedOps` →
 * `enqueueL1ForRange` → the L1-holdback exemption) is reachable only through
 * produce ops — so the solve emits L1 requests for the uncovered ranges.
 * Deterministic.
 *
 * History: this used to walk the plan into the picker one group-atomic
 * raise/lower op at a time. Group ops cannot express a frontier that cuts
 * through a group — which leveled pins legitimately require — so the walk
 * oscillated (the 2026-07-25 Mythos outage; the `raise:L4-936` wedge) and
 * silently rendered "nearest realizable" frontiers that diverged from the
 * plan while plan-vs-actual reported zero drift. The walk is gone; the plan
 * IS the frontier.
